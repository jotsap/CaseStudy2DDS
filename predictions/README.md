## Case Study 2 Predictions  
  
  
*Case2_Predictions_Otsap_Salary.csv* are the salary predictions  
*Case2_Predictions_Otsap_Attrition.csv* are the attrition predictions  
  
NOTE: Was not sure if I need to include *BOTH* the Regression and Random Forest predictions since homework doc said "You MUST use linear regression but MAY include additional models." So just to be safe I'm including both:

* MonthlyIncome_LM = Predictions for Regression
* MonthlyIncome_RF = Predictions for Random Forest
