## Case Study 2 Predictions  
  
  
*Case2_Predictions_Otsap_Salary.csv* are the salary predictions  
*Case2_Predictions_Otsap_Attrition.csv* are the attrition predictions  
  
NOTE: Was not sure if I need to include *BOTH* the Regression and Random Forest for Salary predictions, as well as KNN and Random Forest since homework doc said "You MUST use linear regression but MAY include additional models." So just to be safe I'm including both, but for each prediction set, the Random Forest values are the ones I pick as my final values

* MonthlyIncome_LM = Predictions for Regression
* MonthlyIncome_RF = Predictions for Random Forest - PLEASE USE THESE VALUES FOR FINAL RESULTS

* Attrition_KNN = Preditictions for KNN  
* Attrition_RF = Predictions for RF - PLEASE USE THESE VALUES FOR FINAL RESULTS
